In the U.S., high school students take the SATs, standardized tests designed to assess literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. The exam consists of three sectionsâ€”reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These scores play a crucial role in college admissions, influencing both students' futures and institutional decision-making.

As a Data Analyst, I set out to explore SAT performance across New York City (NYC) public schools. Understanding these trends is valuable for various stakeholders, including education policymakers, researchers, government officials, and parents evaluating school options.

Using the dataset `schools.csv`, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer three key questions about SAT performance in NYC schools. This analysis provides insights into school performance patterns, helping inform discussions on education quality and equity.

By leveraging data analytics, we can uncover meaningful trends in student achievement and contribute to data-driven decision-making in education.
